         <img src="Images/JE.jpg" alt ="Joseph Estrada">
    <p>Joseph Estrada, born Jos√© Marcelo Ejercito on April 19, 1937, is a Filipino actor and politician. He rose to fame as a popular movie star, playing roles as a champion of the poor. His acting career spanned over three decades, earning him the nickname "Erap," which is "Pare" (buddy) spelled backward.

        Estrada entered politics as the mayor of San Juan and served for 17 years. He later became vice president in 1992 and then the 13th President of the Philippines in 1998. His presidency was marked by economic struggles and corruption allegations, which led to his ouster in 2001 through a peaceful uprising known as "EDSA II."
        
        Despite these challenges, Estrada continued his political career and later became the mayor of Manila from 2013 to 2019, where he worked to improve the city.</p>
