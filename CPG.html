            Carlos P. Garcia, born on November 4, 1896, in Talibon, Bohol, was the 8th President of the Philippines (1957-1961). A lawyer, poet, and politician, Garcia is best remembered for his "Filipino First Policy," which aimed to prioritize Filipino businesses and promote economic independence.
            
            Before becoming president, he served as a congressman, senator, and vice president under Ramon Magsaysay. Garcia took office after Magsaysay’s untimely death and continued the former president’s reforms while advocating for nationalism and cultural pride. His administration also strengthened diplomatic ties with Asian neighbors.
            
            Garcia passed away on June 14, 1971, leaving behind a legacy of economic nationalism and strong leadership.</p>
