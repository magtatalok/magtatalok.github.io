         <img src="Images/EQ.jpg" alt ="Elpidio Quirino">
         <p>Elpidio Quirino (1890–1956) was a prominent Filipino politician who served as the sixth President of the Philippines from 1948 to 1953. Born in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, he began his career as a lawyer and entered politics as a member of the Philippine Assembly. Quirino became Vice President under President Manuel L. Quezon and later assumed the presidency following the death of President Sergio Osmeña.

            During his presidency, Quirino focused on post-World War II reconstruction, economic development, and social reform. He implemented various programs to improve infrastructure, education, and healthcare. Quirino's administration faced challenges, including issues related to corruption and the Hukbalahap insurgency. Despite these challenges, he is remembered for his efforts to stabilize the country and promote economic recovery. After his presidency, Quirino remained active in politics but eventually retired from public life. His contributions to the Philippines have left a lasting legacy.</p>
