    <p>
        Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, born on April 5, 1947, in Lubao, Pampanga, is the 14th President of the Philippines, serving from 2001 to 2010. She is the daughter of former President Diosdado Macapagal. Arroyo holds a degree in Economics from Georgetown University and a doctorate in the same field from the University of the Philippines.
        
        Before becoming president, she served as a senator from 1992 to 1998 and Vice President from 1998 to 2001. Her presidency was marked by economic reforms, infrastructure development, and efforts to combat poverty. However, it was also marred by allegations of corruption and electoral fraud.
        
        Arroyo remains an influential figure in Philippine politics, having also served as Speaker of the House of Representatives. Her legacy is one of both achievement and controversy.</p>
