         <p>Manuel Roxas (1892â€“1948) was a Filipino politician and the first President of the independent Third Republic of the Philippines, serving from 1946 until his death in 1948. Born in Capiz, Roxas was educated at the University of the Philippines and later at Harvard University. He began his political career as a member of the Philippine Assembly and quickly rose through the ranks, eventually becoming a prominent figure in the Nacionalista Party.

            Roxas played a significant role during World War II, serving as a leader of the Philippine Commonwealth government in exile. After the war, he was elected as the first President of the newly established Third Republic in 1946, where he focused on post-war reconstruction and economic recovery. He was known for his efforts to strengthen U.S.-Philippine relations and his commitment to rebuilding the nation. Roxas's presidency was marked by significant challenges, including addressing the impacts of war and the rise of communist insurgency. He passed away in 1948 while still in office, leaving a legacy as a key figure in the early years of Philippine independence.</p>
