    <p>
        Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino III (February 8, 1960 – June 24, 2021) was the 15th President of the Philippines, serving from 2010 to 2016. He was the son of democracy icons Benigno Aquino Jr. and former President Corazon Aquino. Noynoy’s presidency was marked by his focus on anti-corruption initiatives and economic reforms. His administration promoted transparency and spearheaded projects like the "Daang Matuwid" campaign, which aimed to reduce government corruption.
        
        Aquino also played a crucial role in the Philippines' legal victory against China in the South China Sea dispute through the Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016. Despite controversies, his leadership left a legacy of economic growth and improved government accountability. He passed away in 2021 due to complications from renal disease.</p>
