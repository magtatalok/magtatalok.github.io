        <h2>My Autobiography</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is <b>Jayson V. Felipe</b>, and I was born in Mu√±oz, Nueva Ecija on November 11. Growing up in Talavera, Nueva Ecija, I was surrounded by a loving family and an environment that nurtured my curiosity and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
            From a young age, I developed a deep passion for some Technical matters, which has been a central part of my life ever since. My love for Electronics has given me a sense of purpose and joy, allowing me to explore different aspects of myself and the world around me.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and watching movies, which help me stay balanced and inspired. Spending time with loved ones, or discovering new interests, I find fulfillment in staying active and connected to what matters most in life.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe in the power of continuous learning and self-improvement. Every experience, whether good or bad, has contributed to my growth and shaped the person I am today. My journey is far from over, and I look forward to embracing future challenges with the same enthusiasm and dedication.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am now a student of <b>Computer Science</b>, where I continue to fuel my interest in problem-solving, programming, and exploring the endless possibilities in the digital world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I hope to continue making a positive impact in both my personal life and my community, and I look forward to what the future holds.
        </p>
