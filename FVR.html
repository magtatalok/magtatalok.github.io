    <p>Fidel V. Ramos (March 18, 1928 â€“ July 31, 2022) was the 12th President of the Philippines, serving from 1992 to 1998. A graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, Ramos had a distinguished military career and played a pivotal role in the 1986 People Power Revolution that ousted the Marcos dictatorship.

        As president, Ramos focused on political stability, economic reforms, and infrastructure development, helping to rebuild the country after years of dictatorship and economic decline. Under his leadership, the Philippines experienced economic growth and opened itself to globalization. Known for his pragmatic leadership and "Unity, Solidarity, and Teamwork" mantra, Ramos is widely credited with bringing stability to the country during a critical time.</p>
