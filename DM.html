    <p>Diosdado Macapagal (1910â€“1997) was the 9th President of the Philippines, serving from 1961 to 1965. Born to a poor family in Lubao, Pampanga, he rose from humble beginnings through education and hard work. Macapagal was a lawyer, economist, and diplomat. His presidency focused on economic reforms, anti-corruption measures, and land reform programs. He is best remembered for moving the Philippine Independence Day from July 4 to June 12, marking the country's independence from Spanish rule. After his presidency, he remained active in public service and politics until his death.</p>
