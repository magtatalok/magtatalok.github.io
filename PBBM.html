    <p>
        Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. was born on September 13, 1957, in Manila, Philippines. He is the son of former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. and Imelda Marcos. Marcos Jr. studied at the Ateneo de Manila University and later attended the University of Oxford, where he earned a degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics.

He began his political career in the 1980s, serving as a member of the Philippine House of Representatives and later as a senator. In 2016, he ran for vice president but lost to Leni Robredo in a closely contested election. Despite the loss, he remained a prominent political figure.

Marcos Jr. was elected as the 17th President of the Philippines in May 2022, campaigning on a platform of unity and economic recovery. His presidency has drawn both support and criticism, particularly regarding his family's political legacy and issues surrounding human rights during his father's regime.</p>
