    <p>Manuel L. Quezon (1878–1944) was a prominent Filipino statesman and leader, known as the "Father of the Philippine Commonwealth." He served as the first President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines from 1935 to 1944 under U.S. colonial rule. A skilled politician and advocate for independence, Quezon worked tirelessly to advance the country's autonomy, leading to the passing of the Tydings–McDuffie Act, which paved the way for Philippine independence.
