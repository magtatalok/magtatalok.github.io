    <p>
        Rodrigo Roa Duterte, born on March 28, 1945, in Maasin, Leyte, is a Filipino politician and lawyer who served as the 16th President of the Philippines from June 30, 2016, to June 30, 2022. He studied political science at the University of the Philippines and later earned a law degree from San Beda College.
        
        Before his presidency, Duterte served as the mayor of Davao City for over two decades, where he gained a reputation for his tough stance on crime and local governance. His administration focused on anti-drug campaigns, infrastructure development, and economic reforms, often sparking controversy for its aggressive methods.
        
        Duterte's presidency was marked by significant foreign policy shifts, including strengthening ties with China and a more strained relationship with the United States. His leadership style, characterized by directness and populism, garnered both strong support and intense criticism. After his term, Duterte's legacy remains a topic of significant debate in Philippine politics.</p>
