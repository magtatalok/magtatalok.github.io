         <img src="Images/FM.jpg" alt ="Ferdinand Marcos Sr.">
    <p>Ferdinand Marcos Sr. (1917â€“1989) was the 10th president of the Philippines, serving from 1965 to 1986. A lawyer and politician, Marcos ruled for 21 years, initially bringing infrastructure development and economic growth. However, his presidency became highly controversial after he declared martial law in 1972, which led to widespread human rights abuses, corruption, and suppression of political opposition. His regime was marked by cronyism and accumulation of wealth by his family and allies.

        He was ousted during the 1986 People Power Revolution and lived in exile in Hawaii, where he died in 1989. Despite his divisive legacy, his policies and influence continue to shape Philippine politics and history.</p>
